            "correct_answer": "A",
            "explanation": "Design patterns are standardized, reusable solutions to common design problems that occur in software architecture within a specific context—not full implementations or universal algorithms."
        },
        {
            "question": "Why are design patterns important in software development?",

            "correct_answer": "A",
            "explanation": "A design pattern is typically described using four elements: Name (for identification), Problem (when to apply), Solution (structure/relationships), and Consequences (trade-offs)."

        {
            "question": "Which statement defines the Singleton Design Pattern?",
            "option_a": "A. Ensures a class has only one instance",

            "correct_answer": "A",
            "explanation": "The Singleton pattern restricts instantiation to one object and provides a global point of access to it, but thread safety must be explicitly implemented."

            "correct_answer": "A",
            "explanation": "A Java Singleton uses a private constructor to prevent external instantiation, a static variable to hold the single instance, and a static accessor method (e.g., getInstance())."

            "correct_answer": "A",
            "explanation": "Singletons model entities that must be unique in a system—e.g., a country has one president, a system typically has one file manager or print spooler."

            "correct_answer": "A",
            "explanation": "Singletons conserve resources and offer global access, but they often complicate testing due to global state and tight coupling."

        {
            "question": "Which statement defines the Observer Pattern?",
            "option_a": "A. Defines one-to-many dependency between objects",

            "option_d": "D. ConcreteObserver",
            "correct_answer": "A",
            "explanation": "The Observer pattern includes an abstract Subject (manages observers), Observer interface (defines update method), and their concrete implementations."
        },
        {
            "question": "Which statements describe the Subject class in Observer pattern?",
            "option_a": "A. Maintains a list of observers",

            "option_c": "C. Notifies observers on state change",
            "option_d": "D. Implements observer interface",
            "correct_answer": "A",
            "explanation": "The Subject manages observer registration and notifies them upon state changes; it does not implement the Observer interface—that’s the role of ConcreteObserver."
        },
        {
            "question": "Which real-world system demonstrates the Observer pattern?",
            "option_a": "A. Social media follower notifications",

            "option_c": "C. Tsunami warning system",
            "option_d": "D. Centralized logging system",
            "correct_answer": "A",
            "explanation": "In social media, users (observers) subscribe to posts or updates from accounts (subjects)—a classic one-to-many notification model matching the Observer pattern."
        },
        {
            "question": "Which are advantages of the Observer pattern?",
            "option_a": "A. Promotes loose coupling between objects",

            "option_c": "C. Simplifies one-to-many communication",
            "option_d": "D. Guarantees sequential update order",
            "correct_answer": "A",
            "explanation": "Observer decouples subjects from observers, supports runtime subscription changes, and streamlines broadcast communication—but does not guarantee update order."
