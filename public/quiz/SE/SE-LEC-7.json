            "correct_answer": "A",
            "explanation": "Valid internal behaviors in a UML state are 'entry', 'do', and 'exit', which define actions performed on entering, during, and on exiting the state."

            "correct_answer": "A",
            "explanation": "The 'do' activity is an ongoing behavior that runs while the object remains in the state and stops when the state is exited, possibly due to interruption."

            "correct_answer": "A",

            "correct_answer": "A",
            "explanation": "Change events use 'when()' syntax and fire when a specified Boolean condition becomes true, making them ideal for monitoring thresholds or state changes."

            "question": "Which describe Time Events correctly?",
            "option_a": "A. Represent transitions triggered by time passage",
